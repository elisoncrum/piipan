# Quickstart Integration Guide for States

This guide is to help development teams working at state and territory governments integrate their SNAP eligibility systems with the NAC. 

## Overview

In order to onboard to the NAC, states will need to:

1. Upload de-identified participant data to the NAC on daily basis
1. Conduct searches against the NAC during certification, recertification, and the addition of household members
1. Resolve matches identified by the NAC

### Uploading De-identified participant data to the NAC
Follow these steps to provide the daily participant information that the NAC will need to detect possible duplicate participation in your state:

1. Understand the NAC material in the [system overview](https://github.com/18F/piipan#overview) and our [introduction to our Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage approach](https://github.com/18F/piipan/blob/dev/docs/pprl-plain.md).
1. Understand which participants are considered [`active participants`](/etl/docs/bulk-import.md#definition-of-active-participants).
1. Export data for active SNAP participants from your eligibility system to a plain text CSV file.
    1. Exclude SNAP particpants who are [missing key data fields](/etl/docs/bulk-import.md#participant-records-to-exclude) or are not considered [active participants](/etl/docs/bulk-import.md#definition-of-active-participants)
1. Transform the plain text CSV to the [Bulk Upload CSV format](../etl/docs/bulk-import.md), in accordance with the [Personal Identifiable Information (PII) de-identification](./pprl.md) specification.
1. Integrate with the [Bulk Upload API](./openapi/generated/bulk-api/openapi.md) to submit the CSV to the NAC using the `/upload` operation.

### Conduct searches against the NAC
As a part of each certification, recertification, and addition of a household member, take the following steps:

1. Determine which individuals need to be included in the NAC search:
    1. For applications and recertifications, all applicants in the household should be included in NAC searches.
    1. For additions of household members, only the individuals being added to the household should be included in NAC searches.  Members of the household who have already been certified for benefits should not have new NAC searches performed.
1. De-identify PII of the individuals using the [PII de-identification specification](./pprl.md)
1. Integrate with the Duplicate Participation API's `/find_matches` call to conduct searches using the de-identified PII from the previous step.

### Resolve matches identified by the NAC
At this time, no integration steps are needed to resolve matches. Case workers can log in to the NAC website to learn about matches and record resolutions.

## Introduction to NAC APIs
The NAC provides 2 web service APIs for state integrations:

1. [Bulk Upload API](./openapi/generated/bulk-api/openapi.md)
1. [Duplicate Participation API](./openapi/generated/duplicate-participation-api/openapi.md)

Each API has one or more RPC or REST operations and uses JSON in the operation request and/or response bodies. All operations must be made over HTTPS and authenticated by an API key. Each state will be issued a key for the Bulk Upload API and a separate key for the Duplicate Participation API.

## Environments

Several isolated NAC systems are being built for states to use:

| Environment    | Purpose                                 | Status    | API hostname                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Testing        | For initial testing with synthetic data | Available | tts-apim-duppartapi-test.azure-api.net |
| Pre-production | For testing with real data at scale     | Pending   | -                                      |
| Production     | For production use with real data       | Pending   | -                                      |

## Usage notes

### De-identification testing
- Correct de-identification in accordance with our defined process is critical for cross-state matching. We strongly recommend unit testing your de-identification code, [covering the specific normalization and validation scenarios we describe](./pprl.md). The NAC team is exploring strategies to verify state-performed de-identification in an automated, ongoing fashion.

### Record retention
- Save API responses received from the duplicate participation API for 3 years.
- API responses that are used for SNAP eligibility determinations are subject to the requirements of 7 CFR 272.1(f).

### Failed requests
- Bulk uploads can be resubmitted as required; the most recent upload will overwrite any pre-existing participant snapshot.

## Sample records

The test environment currently includes three sample states (i.e., `EA`, `EB`, `EC`) that reflect an upload of this [de-identified example CSV](../etl/docs/csv/example.csv). 

The [plain text CSV](../etl/docs/csv/plaintext-example.csv) that this file is derived from is also published. Searching for any of the individuals in the [plain text CSV](../etl/docs/csv/plaintext-example.csv) should return back a match result.
